[{"key":"0","value":"{\"id\":0,\"slug\":\"the_fool\",\"description\":\"On The Fool Tarot card, a young man stands on the edge of a cliff, without a care in the world, as he sets out on a new adventure. He is gazing upwards toward the sky (and the Universe) and is seemingly unaware that he is about to skip off a precipice into the unknown. Over his shoulder rests a modest knapsack containing everything he needs – which isn’t much (let’s say he’s a minimalist). The white rose in his left hand represents his purity and innocence. And at his feet is a small white dog, representing loyalty and protection, that encourages him to charge forward and learn the lessons he came to learn. The mountains behind The Fool symbolize the challenges yet to come. They are forever present, but The Fool doesn’t care about them right now; he’s more focused on starting his expedition.\",\"upright\":\"Folly, mania, extravagance, intoxication, delirium, frenzy, bewrayment\",\"reversed\":\"Negligence, absence, distribution, carelessness, apathy, nullity, vanity.\",\"type\":0}"},{"key":"1","value":"{\"id\":1,\"slug\":\"the_magician\",\"description\":\"The Magician is depicted with one hand pointing upwards towards the sky and the other pointing down to the earth, interpreted widely as an \\\"as above, so below\\\" reference to the spiritual and physical realms. On the table before him are a cup, a sword, a wand, and a pentacle, representing the four suits of the Minor Arcana. Such symbols signify the classical elements of earth, air, fire and water, \\\"which lie like counters before the adept, and he adapts them as he wills\\\". The Magician's right hand, pointed upwards, holds a double-ended white wand; the ends are interpreted much like the hand gestures, in that they represent the Magician's status as conduit between the spiritual and the physical. His robe is similarly also white, a symbol of purity yet also of inexperience, while his red mantle is understood through the lens of red's wildly polarised colour symbolism—both a representative of willpower and passion, and one of egotism, rage, and revenge. In front of the Magician is a garden of Rose of Sharon roses and lily of the valley lillies demonstrating the \\\"culture of aspiration\\\", or the Magician's ability to cultivate and fulfill potential.\",\"upright\":\"Skill, diplomacy, address, subtlety; sickness, pain, loss, disaster, snares of enemies; self-confidence.\",\"reversed\":\"Physician, Magus, mental disease, disgrace, disquiet\",\"type\":0}"}]
